The Better SLS Project
===========================
This project was created to propose a change in the St Luke's School website, shifting away from myschoolapp

Why does the website need a change
----------------------------------
The website is at oftentimes slow, buggy and oftentimes unreliable to the point where it can take a full system restart to load the website. It also has many design issues

What are you going to change
------------------
* [ ] Adding Dark Mode
* [ ] Adding Page For Feature Requests and Bug Reports
* [ ] Using Vue to Make the website faster
* [ ] Using PostgreSQL and MongoDB for faster response
* [ ] Making a Usable Mobile UI
